<h2>How to get an account?</h2>
If you do not yet have an account:
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>If you are a faculty member</b>, you likely have an LDAP account. It is usually your u:account with a "cs" suffix. This account is used to login to the cluster.<br>
        However, you have to be added to the list of "allowed" accounts (i.e., to the slurm database). Please write an email and include the following information, so we can add you:
        <ul>
            <li>Your CS account name.</li>
            <li>Your research group(s).</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>If you are a student</b>, please write an email with (at least) the following information:
        <ul>
            <li>Your u:account name.</li>
            <li>A description why you need access (e.g., your project, supervisor, ...).</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>If you are a faculty member but do not have an LDAP account</b>, please ask <i>your local technician</i> whether you can get one ... and then either write us your LDAP account or your u:account name.
    </li>
</ul>
